# Results snapshot (what the repo contains)

This repo includes:
- canonical run outputs for Runs G–R (CSV tables, diagnostics, plots)
- input packs used by the harness
- supporting tables (CMB comparison, sigmaDir sensitivity, mask scans)

The intended workflow is:
1) reproduce harness fits from packs
2) inspect operator fits (K–Q)
3) use Run R to reason about identifiability thresholds for hidden structure (“clumps”)
