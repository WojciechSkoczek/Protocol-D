# Protocol D — Run H: subspace/plane diagnostic (post Run G)

Run H quantifies the identifiability issue in 2-axis fits and tests whether CMB-alignment is a mixing artefact.

## Key quantities
- BAO-only ĝ angle to CMB.
- SYS ĝ (physics axis) angle to CMB.
- SYS ŝ (operator axis) angle to CMB.
- Distance of CMB direction to the {ĝ, ŝ} plane (0° means CMB lies in the plane).

## Interpretation guide
- If BAO-only ĝ is CMB-aligned but SYS ĝ reverts to the non-Quaia direction, then CMB-alignment was a compromise.
- If CMB distance to plane is small, the decomposition is a basis choice inside a nearly fixed plane.
- Compare LOO stability (mean angular change) for BAO vs SYS.
