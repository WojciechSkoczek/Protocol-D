# Runs G–R (what they mean, where to find outputs)

All canonical outputs are available in `results/runs/` and as original zip bundles in `results/bundles/`.

## Run G — baseline BAO harness summary
Purpose: baseline model comparison and LOO ranking.

## Run H — subspace comparison
Purpose: check whether direction changes are driven by the Quaia subspace.

## Run I — Quaia inclusion ladder
Purpose: stepwise inclusion of redshift bins (low/mid/high) and stability checks.

## Run J — Quaia systematics scenarios
Purpose: alternative Quaia constructions (debias, conservative systematics, mask scans).

## Run K — Operator / Banach framing (O2)
Purpose: add a Quaia-only operator axis ŝ with amplitude A(bmin,magcut).

## Run L–O — Operator variants, rank-2, model selection
Purpose: operator manifold / param operator / 2-axis operator / selecting best model family.

## Runs P–Q — Shared operator across packs/variants
Purpose: test whether a single operator axis ŝ (and coefficients) explains the directional scatter across multiple datasets.

## Run R — “Clumps” identifiability sweep
Purpose: inject a rank-2 component and determine threshold amplitude for detectability.
