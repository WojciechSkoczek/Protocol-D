Protocol D — Context Summary (operator/Banach framing of the dipole tension)
Version: v0.6.2
Author: Wojciech Skoczek

Purpose
-------
A recurring difficulty in “dipole tension” analyses is that the measured dipole is not a direct observable of the underlying cosmological field. It is an observable of the catalogue map: the sky after it has been pushed through a sequence of selection, masking, photometric cuts, depth variations, and pipeline choices. In functional terms, the observation is best described as the action of an operator on an underlying field rather than a transparent read-out of that field.

This repository (Protocol D) is a reproducible analysis harness intended to (i) stabilise the core dipole amplitude with a BAO-anchored ladder, (ii) model the residual directional behaviour with a low-rank selection operator, and (iii) test invariance and rank (rank-1 vs rank-2) as a disciplined identifiability programme.

Why an operator view (Banach-style intuition)
---------------------------------------------
Instead of assuming a priori that the “natural geometry” is a (Hilbert) geometry where orthogonality and spherical-harmonic decompositions are privileged, I treat the catalogue pipeline as a bounded, testable mapping. The question becomes: which components of the inferred dipole are stable under operator perturbations (changes in selection and masking), and which components are generated by the operator itself?

This framing does not reduce testability. It yields concrete tests:
- invariance tests across independent measurement packs, cuts, and variants,
- rank tests (one-axis vs two-axis operator structure),
- plateau checks as a function of depth.

Core result: BAO anchoring improves conditioning
-----------------------------------------------
Within Protocol D, anchoring the core amplitude through a BAO-based ladder substantially reduced the structural instability encountered in “float-amplitude” fits.

Interpretation: the amplitude degree of freedom can otherwise absorb catalogue-dependent distortions and induce spurious directional variability. Once the amplitude is stabilised, the remaining directional scatter becomes a more meaningful object of study.

Low-rank selection operator (rank-1) captures much of the residual behaviour
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The residual excess vector (over the kinematic/CMB expectation) can be modelled as a low-dimensional selection operator:
- a fixed axis (unit vector),
- an amplitude that depends smoothly on selection variables (notably Galactic latitude cut and magnitude threshold),
- gated so that it is activated only for Quaia points (to preserve identifiability and prevent “cheating” by absorbing non-Quaia behaviour).

Two invariance findings are central:
1) Across packs: enforcing a shared operator axis and shared amplitude coefficients across independent measurement packs is preferred by information criteria. This indicates that the selection-driven drift behaves like a stable operator geometry rather than an idiosyncratic artefact of any single implementation.
2) Across variants (baseline vs 2MRS-cleaned): the same operator geometry persists across variants. Joint fits with a shared operator are preferred over separate fits, reinforcing that the operator is a stable feature of the catalogue-map mapping.

Rank test: “local clumps” as rank-2 structure
---------------------------------------------
If unrecognised matter clumps (or other distortions) introduce an additional independent drift direction in selection space, the effective operator should become rank-2. Protocol D compares a rank-1 operator to a rank-2 extension (with orthogonalised axes and similar selection-feature dependence). Sensitivity injections show that a second component must exceed a non-trivial amplitude threshold before rank-2 becomes preferred by AICc.

Since the real data favour rank-1 descriptions, any genuinely independent second-axis “clump field” must either be below that scale or project predominantly onto the existing rank-1 axis.

Implication: identifiability over “isotropy vs anisotropy”
---------------------------------------------------------
This operator framing shifts the central question from a binary “isotropy versus anisotropy” narrative to an identifiability programme:
(i) stabilise the core term (conditioning),
(ii) model and test invariance of the selection operator across packs/variants (stability of the mapping),
(iii) test rank (whether an additional independent component is demanded).

Only after controlling for the mapping-induced operator is it meaningful to interpret any residual alignment or misalignment with the CMB dipole as cosmological.

The wider theoretical context (Modal Wave Theory/MWT, Banach-space intuition and its broader applications) is described in my popular-science book:

Note: The book provides narrative and conceptual context; this repository focuses on reproducible tests and model comparisons related to Protocol D.
MWT is a concept, a hypothesis, not a full-fledged theory.
